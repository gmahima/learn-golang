# Learn Golang

This repository documents my journey learning the Go programming language.

## About Go

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language designed at Google. It's statically typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

## Repository Structure

This repository will be organized to track my progress learning various Go concepts, including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Functions and packages
- Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- Error handling
- Testing
- Web development with Go
- And more!
